\todo[inline]{Write Micro-Architectural Impacts section}
This section explores how our choice of CPU and SoC impacted our results. Previous work has shown that page faults are relatively cheap on simple in-order cores like Rocket. We may do some experiments with BOOM (the out-of-order RISC-V core), but it's not clear we'll be able to do full PFA experiments with it before the end of the semester. We may use some models to explore how increased page fault costs, increased application complexity, or increased core counts might change our conclusions.
