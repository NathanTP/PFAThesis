Obviously this will depend on our final results. I may try to lay out the conditions under which this design point makes sense (a la ``Gang Scheduling Not Worth It...Yet''). This will also be an opportunity to step back and look at the larger disaggregated memory landscape. We really started this project as a way of feeling out the limits of performance and getting concrete numbers for evaluating if disaggregation makes sense at all. At the end of the day, cache-like approaches will be highly desirable in a disaggregated setting, we need to understand its limitations.
