\todo[inline]{Write End-to-End Performance section}
This is the key experiment. I will run the benchmarks with and without the PFA, while also varying network properties. Given prior experiments and my understanding of our implementation, I expect to see modest improvements here. The base-case will be swapping to a RAM disk (full linux SW stack) with delays added to simulate network latency.

I would really like to have a comparison with a fully hardware-managed DRAM cache. I'm not sure how realistic that really is. We might be able to plug some sort of cache simulator into Rocket, or we could use published numbers for DRAM cache performance. I'm not sure what the best course of action is on this.
