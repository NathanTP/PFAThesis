I would like to first thank Emmanuel Amaro who was integral to the design,
motivation, and hardware implementation of the PFA. Howard Mao contributed
significantly to general infrastructure and implemented the memory blade. The
FireSim simulator was the work of many in the Berkeley architecture research
group (BAR), especially Sagar Karandikar. I would also like to thank those in
the BAR group, and the RISC-V Foundation for supplying the underlying
infrastructure for this research.  Finally, I acknowledge my advisers Prof.
Randy Katz and Prof. John Kubiatowicz, as well as Prof. Krste Asanovic, for
their guidance throughout this project.
