\todo[inline]{Write PFA Design Section}
This section describes the PFA design in general. This is not a concrete implementation, but rather the specification of it's behavior and interfaces. This will be based off the \href{https://github.com/WabashOS/riscv-isa-sim/blob/pfa/pfa_spec.md}{PFA specification}.

This work was an equal contribution of myself, Emmanuel, Howie, and Sagar.
