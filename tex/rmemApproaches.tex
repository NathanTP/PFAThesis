\todo[inline]{Write Remote Memory Approach section}
This section serves as a survey of potential approaches to accessing remote memory from software. It will cover at least the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Related work (soNUMA, various memory blades, DRAM caches, etc.). \cite{sonuma}
    \item References to previous projects I've done (e.g. porting Spark to use disaggregated memory, Nephele, etc.).
    \item Network-based experiments performed at Berkeley (but not by me). This is the core motivation for the PFA project. Emmanuel+Peter Gao measured OS paging overheads for a number of benchmarks.
\end{itemize}
