\todo[inline]{Experimental Design}
This section will cover FireSim, network parameters, and the memory blade model we're using. It will also cover the benchmarks. Benchmarks will include at least a subset of Spec and a genome assembly benchmark, but hopefully also some neural networks and possibly even a distributed reinforcement-learning application (Ray).
