\todo[inline]{Write Linux Implementation section}
This section covers the bulk of my personal implementation efforts. It will cover how Linux works right now internally, and then the changes that were made to integrate PFA support. It will also go into the bookkeeping daemon (kpfad) and some of the design considerations there.
