\todo[inline]{Write Hardware Implementation section}
This section covers more concrete implementations of the PFA itself. I will cover both the software ISA simulator (work I did) and the RTL implementation (work Emmanuel did). It also includes a general introduction to the RISC-V ecosystem (including the SoC generator "RocketChip" and the simple in-order CPU "RocketCore").
